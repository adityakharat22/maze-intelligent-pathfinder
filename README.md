# Intelligent Pathfinding

This project implements and visualizes various pathfinding algorithms in a maze environment using Python and Pygame.

## Project Overview

The Intelligent Pathfinding project demonstrates the following algorithms:

1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
3. A* Search

These algorithms are applied to a randomly generated maze, and their performance is compared in terms of execution time and path efficiency.

## Features

- Random maze generation with adjustable complexity
- Implementation of DFS, BFS, and A* pathfinding algorithms
- Visual representation of the maze and solution paths using Pygame
- Performance comparison of the algorithms

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-pathfinding.git
   cd intelligent-pathfinding
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to generate a maze and solve it using all three algorithms:
